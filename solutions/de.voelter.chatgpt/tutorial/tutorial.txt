I have this XML format for describing questionnaires. I will explain this format to 
you. Please use it when providing answers to my prompts.

--------------

A questionnaire is enclosed by the <questionnaire> tag. It has a name attribute.
Inside a <questionnaire> there are <field> and <calculation> tags, each with a 
type and a type. Here is an example:

<questionnaire name="FeverQuestionnaire">
  <field name="measuredTemperature" type="int"/>
  <field name="doYouHaveAHeadache" type="boolean"/>
  <calculation name="deltaFever" type="int"/>
</questionnaire>

Calculations are optional; they should only be added if they make sense.
Not every questionnaire needs calculations.

---------------

The data types that are available are int (for numbers), boolean (for truth values)
and enumerations. You have seen examples for int and boolean above. Here is an
example for an enum; it lists its literals in curly braces, separated by comma.

<questionnaire name="FeverQuestionnaire"/>
  <field name="gender" type="{male, female, other}"/>
</questionnaire>
