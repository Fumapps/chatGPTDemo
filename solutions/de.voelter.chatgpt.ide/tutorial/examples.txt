Generate a questionnaire that assesses someone's sleep quality.

Can you use an alternatives expression in the overallSleepQuality calculation instead of the if?

Add a field that represents the intended hours of sleep.

Now add a calculation that is true if the hoursOfSleep is less than half of the intendedHoursOfSleep

Can you use an enum for the feelingRefreshed field?
